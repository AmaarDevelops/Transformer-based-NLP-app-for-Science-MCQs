AI-Powered Science Quiz Generator

📖 Overview

Creating high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) is essential in education but often time-consuming and repetitive. This project solves that by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate context-aware science quizzes from any given text.

👉 Input: A block of scientific text with 4 options
👉 Output: Well-structured MCQs with correct answers and realistic distractors

This showcases how AI + web development can create real-world EdTech tools that benefit educators and students alike.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python → Core application logic

Hugging Face Transformers → Pre-trained NLP model for question generation

Flask → REST API to serve AI predictions

HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Jinja) → Interactive frontend for quiz creation

🤖 AI Model Workflow

User Input → Paste any scientific passage with 4 options in the inputs

Backend Processing → Flask sends text to Hugging Face model

NLP Model → Extracts key concepts, generates a question, correct answer, and distractors

Output → JSON response rendered as multiple-choice questions in the browser

This pipeline demonstrates end-to-end model deployment — from NLP preprocessing to frontend integration.
